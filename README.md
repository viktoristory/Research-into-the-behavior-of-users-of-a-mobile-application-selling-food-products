A study for a startup that sells food products. It is necessary to understand how users of a mobile application behave.
The sales funnel was studied, how users reach the purchase. How many users reach the purchase, and how many get “stuck” at the previous steps, at which ones.
After that, the results of the A/A/B experiment were studied. The designers wanted to change the fonts in the entire application, and the managers were afraid that users would be unfamiliar with it. They agreed to make a decision based on the results of the A/A/B test. Users were divided into 3 groups: 2 control groups with old fonts and one experimental group with new ones. One of the points of the study was to find out which font is better.
